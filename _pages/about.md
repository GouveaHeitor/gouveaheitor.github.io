### Bio

Born and raised in a city in the interior of Brazil, I wrote my first lines of code at the age of 14, after that I found myself falling in love with the computing universe and the offensive security area. When I finished high school, I moved to greater São Paulo to start my career so far in software development and, two years later, I finally managed to fulfill my dream and work with Information Security.

### About

![Image](/images/photos/profile.jpg){:height=600px" width="360px" style="float:right; padding:10px"}

After two years working in the software development area in the Brazilian government, I worked as an Information Security Analyst in a Red Team with some amazing Brazilian Security Companies of Consulting, like: OGASEC, Deloitte Brazil and CIPHER; and after this I decided to start a career as an Independent Researcher so that I could concentrate on things that really made sense to with my purpose.

I am fascinated by the area of offensive security, so I spend many hours studying this segment. In the past, I won some prizes: first place at Bsides São Paulo 16th CTF and Hackaflag qualification in 2019 and first place at Campinas Hackathon in 2017 and in addition, I reported some vulnerabilities in the following Brazilian fintechs/banks: Caixa Econômica Federal, Warren Brazil and some others.

### Research

Aligning my life purpose (create technologies that help people and groups take control of their own information) with my work, I decided to cover the subjects below as the main areas of my research:

- Application Security;
- Privacy/anonymity algorithms;
- Construction of security tools;

And during that research time (until then short) I was able to build some Open Source tools that are available on my [Github](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor){:target="_blank"} in addition I audited some applications/software that earned me some security adivisories:

- [CVE-2019-15032](/2019/09/17/CVE-2019-15032) / [CVE-2019-15033](/2019/09/17/CVE-2019-15033) / [CVE-2020-9376](/2020/03/04/CVE-2020-9376) / [CVE-2020-9377](/2020/03/04/CVE-2020-9377)
