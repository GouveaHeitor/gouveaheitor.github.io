### Bio

Born and raised in a city in the interior of Brazil, I wrote my first lines of code at the age of 14, after that I fell in love with the universe of computing and the offensive area of security. When I finished high school, I moved to Greater São Paulo to start my career so far in software engineering and, two years later, I finally managed to fulfill my dream and work with Information Security.

### About

<!-- ![Image](/images/photos/profile.jpg){:height=600px" width="360px" style="float:right; padding:10px"} -->

After two years working in the area of software engineering in the Brazilian government, I worked as an Information Security Analyst inside some Red Teams alongside some Brazilian security consulting companies, such as OGASEC, Deloitte Brasil, and CIPHER; and after that, I decided to start a career as an Independent Researcher so I could focus on the things that really made sense for my purpose.

As an Independent Researcher I have already found flaws in incredible companies such as: Activision Blizzard, Caixa Econômica Federal, Warren Brazil and others not so famous but equally incredible. And in parallel to this I have also won some awards in the past: first place at Bsides São Paulo 16th CTF and Hackaflag qualification in 2019 and first place at Campinas Hackathon in 2017.

### Research

Aligning my life purpose (create technologies that help people and groups take control of their own information) with my work, I decided to cover the subjects below as the main areas of my research:

- Security Vulnerabilities;
- Privacy/anonymity algorithms;
- Automation of security actions;

And during that research time (until then short) I was able to build some Open Source tools that are available on my [Github](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor){:target="_blank"} in addition I audited some applications/software that earned me some security adivisories:

- [CVE-2019-15032](/2019/09/17/CVE-2019-15032) / [CVE-2019-15033](/2019/09/17/CVE-2019-15033) / [CVE-2020-9376](/2020/03/04/CVE-2020-9376) / [CVE-2020-9377](/2020/03/04/CVE-2020-9377)
