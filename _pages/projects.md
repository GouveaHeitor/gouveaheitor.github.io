## My projects

During my independent research and personal projects I end up creating some tools of my own to solve a problem that I believe is recurring, and on this page you can check out some of these projects that are currently open-source:

* [Nipe:](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/nipe) a script to make TOR Network your default gateway;

<!-- * [Uranus](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/uranus): an ecosystem of crawlers for detecting: leaks, sensitive data exposure and attempts exfiltration of data;

* [Fukon](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/fukon): a simple HTTP fuzzer; -->

* [Security Spellbook](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/security-spellbook): my collection of custom scripts, plugins, exploits and others small things;

* [Perl Style Guide](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/perl-style-guide): a starting point for Perl development teams to provide consistency through good practices;
