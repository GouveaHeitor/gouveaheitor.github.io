## My research projects

During my independent research, I developed some projects in order to solve some recurring problems or validate a theory discovered and on this page, you can check out some of these currently open source projects:

* [Nipe:](/projects/nipe) an engine to make Tor Network your default gateway;

* [Nozaki](/projects/nozaki): HTTP fuzzer engine security oriented;

* [Uranus](/projects/uranus): an ecosystem of crawlers for detecting: leaks, sensitive data exposure and attempts exfiltration of data;

* [Spellbook](/projects/spellbook): micro-framework for rapid development of security audit workflows;

All projects were created independently and involving multidisciplinary knowledge aiming at simplicity and accessibility for the greatest possible number of people.
