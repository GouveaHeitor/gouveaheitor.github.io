## My projects

During my independent research and personal projects I end up creating some tools of my own to solve a problem that I believe is recurring, and on this page you can check out some of these projects that are currently open-source:

* [Nipe:](/projects/nipe) a engine to make Tor Network your default gateway;

* [Nozaki](/projects/nozaki): a simple and complete HTTP fuzzer engine security oriented;

* [Uranus](/projects/uranus): an ecosystem of crawlers for detecting: leaks, sensitive data exposure and attempts exfiltration of data;

* [Spellbook](/projects/spellbook): my collection of custom scripts, plugins, exploits and others small things;

* [Perl Style Guide](/projects/perl-style-guide): a starting point for Perl development teams to provide consistency through good practices;
