## It's time for your Startup to undergo an penetration test

### Introduction:

If you follow the news about technology, you certainly ended up hearing about some companies that were invaded by "hackers" and suffered a huge loss because of this.
If not, I can tell you some of these recent cases:

  - May 2017: crypto-ransomware Wannarcry has affected more than 230,000 systems around the globe.
  - Between May and July 2017, hackers invaded Equifax's servers and stole a database that had data of 143 million Americans, including information on that basis: name, address, phone number,
    and other information about individuals.
  - July 2017: the HBO television channel, announced that hackers had invaded its servers and stolen 1.5 terabytes of data.
  - December 2017: a Brazilian electronics is invaded in an invasion test.

I could go on to mention many other companies / systems that were invaded only in the year 2017, from small businesses to large corporations, but I believe these are enough to
make it clear that information security is no joke. In this article, I'll introduce you to a method that can help you with this famous penetration test.

### What is a penetration test?

An penetration test is nothing more than a set of processes and concepts that use tools, hacking techniques and specific concepts for the evaluation of information security.

It has as main objective to visualize all the vulnerabilities in the environment responsible for the information of a company, such as: computers, web applications, databases, servers and etc.

### What are the benefits of an penetration test?

The need to periodically evaluate the security structure of a business is essential to keeping your customers' data secure.
The leakage of information, in addition to compromising the security, credibility and competitiveness of the company itself, can lead to the loss of customers.
The benefits are many, but it is worth mentioning here some specific:

  - Protect the data of your customers that are under your responsibility;
  - Identify and mitigate failures that may compromise the performance, functionality, and security of your application;
  - Meet the requirements of regulatory standards that require invasion testing for certification;
  - Ensure the integrity of your company image;
  - Test in practice whether contracted security controls are really effective;
  - Use mechanisms to block automated attacks (bots, worms, etc);
  - Access to a complete report with a privileged view of the infrastructure;
  - List the actions needed to correct weaknesses;
  - Possibility to follow the evolution of environmental security;

### How does the penetration test work?

The test most often occurs blindly, where the audit firm will not have access to any information regarding the client's infrastructure. If the test is external,
only the domain to be evaluated will be provided, and if it is internal, access to a single network point will be provided.

Although there are other types, this is the most requested and appropriate methodology, after all, it represents an attempt to attack more faithfully, where an external attacker
coordinates multiple attacks to a domain without necessarily knowing the technological structure of the company behind it.

At the beginning of the process, the recognition stage occurs, the responsible Analyst will collect the maximum information available on the internet about the company that requested the service. Soon after collecting the general information, it is time to start collecting information about the infrastructure, such as the operating systems the company uses, which services operate on each server and their respective versions.

After collecting all relevant information, the scanning phase will begin. In this step, a scan will be performed in search of possible input vectors, which may be used by malicious attackers.
With the possible input vectors identified, the exploration phase is started, the objective is to simulate an invasion in order to evaluate how critical each of these vectors is.

With the attack simulation complete, it is time to draw up a report that lists all the results obtained, vulnerabilities encountered, and what steps should be taken in relation to the outcome.

### How can I help you

Security is a complex and dynamic problem, and most companies do not have the time, knowledge, and capabilities to effectively manage it. I help companies of all shapes and sizes to realistically assess their security position and guide them to respond appropriately to weaknesses. Over time, they better understand the nature of the technology landscape, enhance their defensive capabilities, and correctly identify the elements of their security strategy that need attention.

This attack simulation services provide a means to properly assess security, thus enhancing the defensive capabilities of enterprises.

Attack simulation is the best way to properly assess your security posture. Demonstration of exploitation and exfiltration of data not only helps the business to understand the risks, it helps to prioritize the changes within the organization.
More and more organizations are being compromised, data breaches and business closures are becoming daily news. What would happen to your business if it became the next target?
