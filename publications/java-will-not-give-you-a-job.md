## Java will not give you a job!

When you are young and are looking to build a career in the IT industry most of the staff will tell you to: do the X graduation, learn to program in the Y language and take the Z certification,
because for them, it will be the way for you you have a successful career in the business.

But let me tell you one thing: this is all a big lie.

I bet they told you that the diploma would give you a job, but it was a lie, they wanted the monthly fee. They also told you that the X certification would give you a job, but it was a lie,
they wanted you in the preparatory course. They told you that there is a business called "employability." Well, it may even exist, but I doubt it's what they say it is.

Anyway, Perl, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby or even know all the 200 Frameworks that JavaScript has, will not give you a job. What will give you a job is that you are honest, intelligent,
trustworthy and interested in learning - whatever you have to learn.

I do not know how old you are, but because you're here reading this post, I dare say you're young, just like me, and maybe you left college less than 3 years ago, probably some course related to computer science .

If I had one advice, only one, to give you, would be: use sunscreen - Sorry, I could not resist.

As I have more than one, I tell you: learn as many things as you can while you're still young. In a few more years, you will be able to think more clearly about what it is that you really want to do, and where you think you are going to get along better.

But always take with you the question: "How long do I still have ?!"
