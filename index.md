## About Me

Hi! My name is Heitor GouvÃªa and I am an Cybersecurity Engineer and Instructor.
I have been working on projects that help people, organizations and companies take control of their own security. Currently live in
Campinas, a quiet city in Brazil. I have more than 3 years experience of Offensive Information Security.

My work is focused on understanding threat models, analyzing existing
applications and building intelligent tools to combat risk current and future security for both individuals or groups.

I have audited high profile websites for security vulnerabilities and have
managed and worked in teams of software developers and computer scientists
delivering high security architectures.

## Research Interest

My researches are in the area of anonymity, privacy, cryptography and cryptanalysis,
more specifically I work on projects that help people take control of their own security.

The largest project I work on is [Nipe](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/nipe): a tool to make Tor Network your default gateway.
Nipe enables you to directly route all your traffic from your computer to the Tor Network through which you can surf the Internet Anonymously without having to worry
about being tracked or traced back. [(media mentions)](https://heitorgouvea.me/nipe/#/?id=community-publications)

I am very interested in offensive security. I have contributed to [Metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework), an information security project for the purpose
of analyzing security vulnerabilities and facilitating penetration testing and the development of signatures for intrusion detection systems.

And I also contribute to the [O-Saft](https://github.com/OWASP/O-Saft), an tools lists  information about remote target's  SSL  certificate and tests the remote target
according given list of ciphers. On my [profile on Github](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor) you can see some of my codes written during my researches.
