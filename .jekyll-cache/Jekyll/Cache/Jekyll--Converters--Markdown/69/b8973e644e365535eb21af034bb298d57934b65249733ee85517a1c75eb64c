<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The #HFBR19 is a Brazilian CTF that took place throughout 2019, organized by the Hackaflag team. This CTF had 12 in-class qualifiers, where each qualifier was held within Roadsec (an itinerant event that takes place in Brazil), ie each qualifier was held in a different state of Brazil, thus ensuring a finalist from each region of the country. I was classified in the first quals, which took place at the beginning of the year, in the city of Campinas, interior of S√£o Paulo, and later competed in the final that took place in November.</p>

<p>The final was about 4 hours long, and we had 10 challenges to solve: 8 of them were challenges related to exploiting Web vulnerabilities, and the rest were related to programming, and this publication aims to explain how the second challenge of programming can be solved.</p>

<p>Within the Hackaflag platform, when the challenge was selected, the information you obtained was as follows:</p>

<p>The only information we had was an IP and a port, so my first move was to use Netcat to try to discover something new, the response of the request is:</p>

<p>Shortly after the ASCII Art illustrated above, there is a value input field, if we do not fill it in, within seconds we receive the following timeout message:</p>

<p>Interacting a little more with this service, we can see the following behaviors, sending the value A, we receive the following response:</p>

<p>And, sending the value Z, we receive the following response:</p>
