<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://pydio.com/">Pydio</a> is a ‚Äúmodern file management platform built according to your business needs and regulations.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>Pydio‚Äôs main functionality is file upload and sharing. One way to upload is through the ‚ÄúRemote Server‚Äù feature, where Pydio makes a request to a remote server on the Internet and downloads the file.</p>

<p><img src="/images/publications/pydio-research/pydio-cve-1.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>The problem here is that Pydio does not handle filters properly on the input of this data, allowing a malicious user to enter a URL to an internal address (see also <a href="/2019/09/17/CVE-2019-15033">CVE-2019-15033</a>), such as: http://localhost</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>And Pydio, in an unsuccessful attempt to make such a request, eventually needs to provide a response to the user. However this response is not well-structured, resulting in the server‚Äôs internal folder path leaking and even stating the username who created this folder:</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>For a better understanding, we can analyze the request below:</p>

<p><img src="/images/publications/pydio-research/pydio-cve-3.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>This vulnerability could be exploited without authentication because another feature of Pydio is the creation and making of folders available for third parties to upload and download files.</p>

<p>This vulnerability could serve as a helper for other vulnerabilities and thus is become even more critical; An example of this is brute-force attacks in an attempt to crack the password of leaked usernames by exploiting this vulnerability.</p>
