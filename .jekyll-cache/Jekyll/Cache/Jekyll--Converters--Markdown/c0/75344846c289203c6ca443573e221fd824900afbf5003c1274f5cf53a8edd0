        Maybe one of the most valuable tips I can give you all is: be organized<br /><br />Due to the extreme amount of targets, techs, payloads and differents contexts, it is very easy to get lost and don&#39;t give enough attention to some of the most important details during your hunt<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bugbountytip?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bugbountytip</a>

<p>A while time ago I did a Tweet about the importance of the effective organization on your annotations for Bug Bounty Hunting and I was asked about how I do it and through this article, I want to share my favorite tool.</p>

<h2 id="swiftnessx-a-cross-platform-note-taking--target-tracking-app-for-penetration-testers">SwiftnessX: ‚ÄúA cross-platform note-taking &amp; target-tracking app for penetration testers‚Äù</h2>

<p><img src="/images/publications/swiftness/home.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Certainly, my favorite tool for information organization is <a href="https://github.com/ehrishirajsharma/SwiftnessX">Swiftness.</a> I discovered it through my Github feed and as soon as I used it for the first time I found myself in love with all the ease and dynamics it delivers.</p>

<p>Swiftness is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and MacOS) annotation software for Pentesters/Bug Bounty Hunters made in ElectronJS.</p>

<h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>

<p>The first feature that I want mention is the section of ‚ÄúTemplates‚Äù, with the content templates for reports, you are reusing reports that you already write in another moment, example:</p>

<p><img src="/images/publications/swiftness/templates.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<h3 id="payloads">Payloads</h3>

<p>In addition, Swiftness has an excellent solution for you to save your Payloads in an organized way:</p>

<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>

<p>Through the Libraries you are able to pre-establish a workflow/checklist that you will follow during your hunting:</p>

<p><img src="/images/publications/swiftness/libraries.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>This for example is a Checklist based on OTGv5. You can download the same by <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ehrishirajsharma/swiftness-static/master/Checklist/OWASP-Testing-Checklist.json">clicking here</a>. You can create your own Libraries.</p>

<p>Switness is an incredible tool, but it by itself is still not enough. I still use a structured folder organization for the files, Quiver for more essay notes, the option for projects in the Burp Suite, and I also try to make my API-related tests in Insomnia well organized. Maybe someday I can write a little more about this in more detail.</p>
