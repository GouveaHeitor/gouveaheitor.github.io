Work with Information Security for over 3 years - alongside startups and medium-sized companies - providing advice on the practice of pen testing, code review, security architecture and training...

I have audited high profile websites for security vulnerabilities and have managed and worked in teams of software developers and computer scientists delivering high security architectures.

My work is focused on understanding threat models, analyzing existing applications and building intelligent tools to combat risk current and future security for both individuals or groups.

There are typically three ways to engage with me:

## Penetration Testing

It is a real attack simulation, this is the best way to properly assess your security posture. Demonstration of exploitation and exfiltration of data not only helps the business to understand the risks, it also helps to prioritize the changes within the organization.

## Development of a Security Design and Architecture

Is the design artifacts that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned and how they relate to the overall systems architecture. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system’s quality attributes such as confidentiality, integrity and availability.

## Information Security Training

I can also conduct training for professionals in the Information Security segment, such as: awareness, use of tools and techniques.
