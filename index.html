      <h2>A LITTLE MORE</h2>
      <p>Information Security is a complex and dynamic problem, and most companies do not have the time, knowledge and skills to effectively manage it. I help companies of all shapes and sizes to evaluate their security position and to respond adequately to weaknesses. Over time, my partners / clients better understand the nature of the technology landscape, improve their capabilities and correctly identify the elements of your security strategy that need attention.</p>
      <p>I help organizations prepare for real-world threats in a safe and minimally disruptive way. My attack simulation services provide a means to properly assess security, thus enhancing the defensive capabilities of companies.</p>
      <p>Attack simulation is the best way to properly assess your security posture. Demonstration of exploration and data exfiltration not only helps the business understand the risks, it helps to prioritize changes within the organization.</p>
      <p>More and more organizations are being compromised, and data breaches and business closures are becoming daily News. What would happen to your business if it became the next target? Let me help you to avoid uncovering the answer to that question!</p>
