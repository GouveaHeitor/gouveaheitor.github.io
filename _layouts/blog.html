    If you think the writer of this text has some potential, take a look at the other things I create. I have a weekly <a href="https://heitorgouvea.me/newsletter">newsletter</a> on
    possibly interesting things and I even think about creating a youtube channel in the future. But seriously, subscribe to the <a href="https://heitorgouvea.me/newsletter">newsletter</a>
    that is very legal and this is the way we can continue to exchange ideas.
