I have practice reading about war strategies, run, attending security conferences and sometimes playing some CTF's.

Today I am living in São Paulo, BR, and here many conferences take place, from the most varied subjects and whenever I can watch some of them.

Here’s what I’m doing now:

- Running an independent information security consultancy. I've been at it for over a year now and have been working with some big brands like Shawee, Github, Deloitte and others equally amazing but not-so-known companies;
- Keeping <a href="https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/nipe" target="_blank_">Nipe</a>: a tool based on the Tor project that assists in the anonymity process of its users, present in several Linux distributions like: Black Arch, Weak Net and LionSec Linux;    
- Every day I study more about security in mobile environments, more specifically on Android systems. I try whenever possible practical and I try to improve my knowledge in this subject within CTF competitions;
- Also, I'm trying to find more time to contribute to others open-source projects;

In the past I’ve done a lot of conference speaking - I’m open to new speaking opportunities so get in touch if you have an event you’d like me to speak at.

I’m always looking to coffee with interesting people, so contact:  <a href="mailto:hi@heitorgouvea.me">hi@heitorgouvea.me</a>
