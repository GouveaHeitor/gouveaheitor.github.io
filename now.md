subtitle: What I'm working on now, inspired by Derek Sivers

I have practice reading about war strategies, run, attending security conferences and sometimes playing some CTF's.

I am living in São Paulo, BR, and here many conferences take place, from the most varied subjects and whenever I can, I attend some of them.

Here’s what I’m up to right now:

 - Running an independent information security consultancy. I've been in this for over a year now and have worked with some big brands like: Shawee, Github, Deloitte and other equally amazing but not-so-known companies;
 - Keeping <a href="https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/nipe" target="_blank_">Nipe</a>: a tool based on the Tor project that assists in the anonymity process of its users, present in several Linux distributions like: Black Arch, Weak Net and LionSec Linux;
 - Every day I study more about Security in Mobile environments, more specifically on Android systems and whenever possible practical and I try to improve my knowledge in this subject within CTF competitions;
 - Also, I'm trying to find more time to contribute to others open-source projects;

In the past I’ve done a lot of conference speaking - I’m open to new speaking opportunities so get in touch if you have an event you’d like me to speak at.

I’m always looking to grab coffee with interesting people so get in touch:  <a href="mailto:hi@heitorgouvea.me">hi@heitorgouvea.me</a>
