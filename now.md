subtitle: What I'm working on now

I like reading about War Strategies, skateboarding, running, attending tech meetups and playing some Capture The Flag.

I am living in SÃ£o Paulo, BR, and here you have many conferences, of the most varied subjects and whenever I can I am attending some of them.

Here's what I'm up to right now:

 - Running an independent Information Security Researching practice. I've been at this almost three years now and have worked with some great brands...
 - Writing a book on the Perl Language applied to the practice of Pentesting
 - Keeping the <a href="https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/nipe" target="_blank_">Nipe project</a>: a project focused on anonymity and digital privacy
 - Studying more and more about Car Hacking...

In the past I've done a lot of conference speaking - I'm open to new speaking opportunities so get in touch if you have an event you'd like me to speak at.

I'm always looking to grab coffee with interesting people so get in touch: <a href="mailto:hi@heitorgouvea.me">hi@heitorgouvea.me</a>
