I am an Independent Security Engineer looking to make the internet more secure. I’m currently have been working on projects that help people, organizations and companies take control of their own informations.

I have audited high profile websites for security vulnerabilities and have managed and worked in teams of software developers and computer scientists delivering high security architectures. My work is focused on understanding threat models, analyzing existing applications and building intelligent tools to combat risk current and future security for both individuals or groups.

I am currently fascinated by the theme of “Car Hacking” as I am sure that a near future this subject will be discussed frequently.
