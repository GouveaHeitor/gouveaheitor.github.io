I am currently working on projects that help people, organizations and companies take control of their own information, as an Independent Information Security Advisor.

## My way here

By the end of 2014, I started studying programming independently and by the end of 2015 I was already fascinated by the world of offensive information security.

In early 2016 I participated in a Hackathon and later I was hired to work in the Brazilian government in the area of ​​Information Technology - I worked in several teams, such as: development, architecture, information security and assistance in the management of large projects. Some time after working as a Trainee, I worked as a Security Analyst for some Brazilian companies, and after a while I decided to start a career as an Independent Security Advisor so that I could concentrate on things that really made sense to my purpose.

During my work as a Security Advisor, I worked alongside incredible companies like Shawee, Github and Bugcrowd and other not-so-famous but equally amazing companies. I am fascinated by the area of ​​offensive security, so I spend many hours studying in this field.

Here are some of the public papers I've written recently:

- [Cryptology: from zero to one;](#)
- [Perl Language: An Approach to Pentesters;](#)
- [Anonymity in cyberspace: the two sides of the coin;](#)

Currently, I am researching about vulnerabilities present in mobile environments, more specifically in Android operating systems, because every day this environment grows more and more, and this subject is discussed more frequently.

## Sharing knowledge

I share in my blog some discoveries that I make during the day-to-day and lessons that I shot of stories that I lived.
In addition, I was a mentor in Hackathons organized by companies like IBM, Assertive Solutions and even by the City Hall of Campinas.
