Hi there, I’m currently have been working on projects that help people, organizations and companies take control of their own informations as an Independent Security Researcher.

## How I Got Here

By the end of 2014 I started to study programming independently, and by the end of 2015 I was already fascinated by the world of offensive information security.

At the beginning of 2016 I participated in a Hackathon and later I was hired to work in the Brazilian Government in the area of ​​Information Technology.
After two years working for the Government, I decided that I would start a career as an Independent Security Researcher, so that I could focus on things that really made sense.

During my work as a Bounty Hunter I worked alongside incredible companies like Cabify, Github and Bugcrowd and other not-so-famous but equally incredible companies.
I am fascinated by the area of ​​offensive security, so I spend many hours studying in this field.

Here are some of the public Papers that I wrote:

- Cryptology: from zero to one;
- Perl language: an approach to Pentesters;
- Anonymity in cyberspace: the two sides of the coin;

I am currently fascinated by the theme of "Car Hacking" as I am sure that a near future this subject will be discussed frequently.

## Knowledge Sharing & Teaching

I share on my blog a lot of discoveries I make during my day-to-day life and some lessons from stories I've lived through.
In addition, I have been a mentor in Hackathons organized by companies such as IBM, Assertiva Solutions and City Hall of Campinas.

Whenever possible, I speaking in technical conferences... More about my [speaking here](https://heitorgouvea.me/speaking).
