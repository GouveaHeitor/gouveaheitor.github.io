# CVE-2019-15033 - Server Side Request Forgery | Pydio Community

## Summary

The [Pydio](https://pydio.com/) is a "modern file management platform built according to your business needs and regulations." 


### Description

Pydio's main functionality is file upload and sharing. One way to upload is through the "Remote Server" feature, where Pydio makes a request to a remote server on the Internet and downloads the file.

The problem here is that Pydio does not handle filters on the input of this data, allowing a malicious user to enter a URL into an internal address (see also [CVE-2019-15032](/2019/09/17/CVE-2019-15032)) that is not directly available to the Internet, such as: http://10.11.18.47:1337/pydio-cve.png

And Pydio, in a successful attempt to make such a request, eventually manages to download a file that is not directly exposed to the Internet, thus resulting in an SSRF - Server Side Request Forgery:

- The internal web server log:

-

This vulnerability could be exploited without authentication because another feature of Pydio is the creation and making of folders available for third parties to upload and download files.

An attacker could take advantage of the vulnerability to make Pydio make forged internal IP requests on a network, mapping and accessing files from an internal network - for greater effectiveness, this could be automated and correlated to a list of services and files presumably that the target company uses.
